# MetaDataScraper

MetaDataScraper is a Python package designed to automate the extraction of information like follower counts, and post details & interactions from a public Facebook page, in the form of a FacebookScraper object. It uses Selenium WebDriver for web automation and scraping.

   scraper = FacebookScraper("page_id")
   ```

3. Scrape the Facebook page to retrieve information:

   ```

4. Access the scraped data from the result dictionary:
